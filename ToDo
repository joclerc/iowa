	*	Expand the Policies available so that sessions can be tracked
		via cookies, automatically.
	*	Improve the parsing of custom tags so that kludges like:

		<PageHeader oid="pageHeader"/>

		are not needed.  Really, we shouldn't have to pass an oid
		with an attribute if we aren't actually doing anything with it.

		<PageHeader/>

		would be great.  This requires a much smarter TemplateParser.
	*	On this same note, improve the header so that it handles certain
		kinds of nesting, such as

		<!-- <PageHeader oid="pageHeader" /> -->

		Or the use of CDATA sections that wrap IOWA tags.  Right now
		both of those cause the parser to get confused.
