These are standalone versions of pieces of IOWA that may be useful on their
own.  Here is where you will find them.  Each is self contained and does
not require IOWA to be installed in order to operate.

Each project is still being kept within the Iowa namespace so that the
potential for a namespace collision is reduced.  I recognize that this
means a few extra keystrokes are required to use one of these, but I
feel the protection against namespace trainwrecks is worth it.
