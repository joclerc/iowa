In this example, we've added some HTML structure to the view, and have
inserted some dynamic content.  The current date and time is now
displayed on every request.

In IOWA applications, code is not inserted directly into a view file.
Rather, methods can be called from the controller, and the return
value of the method will be inserted into the output of the view.

The syntax for this is to use a special tag:

<dynamicstring oid="foo" />

The value of the oid attribute is the name of the method to call.
