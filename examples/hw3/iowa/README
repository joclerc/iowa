Notice that the tag to include dynamic content from the last example:

<dynamicstring oid="foo" />

is missing from this one.  Instead, in its place, is "@foo".

Because the act of invoking a method in the controller to insert dynamic
content is so common, IOWA provides a syntactic shortcut for that.

Any alphanumeric sequence of characters which is preceded with an
at (@) sign is treated as a DynamicString tag for that sequence of
characters.  Dot notation for chaining method calls IS supported.

The other thing that was added to this example is a dynamic link.  When
an <a> tag has an oid attribute, the value of that attribute names the
method that will be called when that link is clicked on.  The reload()
method is a standard one that exists for all components, and does
nothing but allow the current page to be reloaded.
