Remember that IOWA uses a component architecture.  And one of the best
things about components is that they are easy to reuse.  In this
example, instead of repeating the same pieces of header and footer
HTML across more than one view file, those pieces have been extracted
into their own components, Header and Footer.

A little bit of new Ruby syntax is needed, here, in order to ensure
that the needed components have been loaded by IOWA before they are
needed.  Think of 'import' as a 'require' statement for components.

Then, to actually use the component, just write a tag using the
component name as the tag, and give it an oid.  IOWA uses the
existence of oid attribute to signal to it that the tag is dynamic.
