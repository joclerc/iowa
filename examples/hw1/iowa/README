ruby hw.rb -r webrick

This is the simplest IOWA application.  It consists of a ruby file that
requires the main iowa library, and then calls Iowa.run, and a single
view file, Main.html.  The application will be listening on 127.0.0.1,
port 2001.

IOWA applications will pass a request to the Main component by default.
