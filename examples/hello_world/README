Almost a skeleton of an app, this is the ever beloved
"Hello World" with a touch of the dynamic thrown in.
To run it:

cd iowa
ruby iowa_hello_world.rb -r webrick

Then point your web browser at

http://127.0.0.1:2000

By default, this application will be running using the webrick web server.
If you have installed Mongrel (gem install mongrel), though, you may
also run it with Mongrel:

ruby iowa_hello_world.rb -r mongrel
